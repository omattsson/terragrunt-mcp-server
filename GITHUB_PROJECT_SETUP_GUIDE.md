- **Action:** Set Status to "Done"

### Auto-set Priority from Labels
- **Trigger:** Label "priority: high" added
- **Action:** Set Priority to "High"

To set up automation:
1. Go to project settings (‚öôÔ∏è gear icon)
2. Click **Workflows**
3. Click **Create workflow**
4. Choose your trigger and action

## Tips for Effective Project Management

1. **Start with Epic Overview** - Get the big picture
2. **Use Current Sprint daily** - Focus on what's actively worked on
3. **Review Testing Backlog** before starting new features - Don't accumulate test debt
4. **Group by Feature** when planning sprints - See all work for a feature together
5. **Group by Priority** when triaging - Focus on high-priority items first
6. **Use Milestones** for time-based tracking - They're already set up!
